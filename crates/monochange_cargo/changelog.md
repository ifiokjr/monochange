# Changelog

All notable changes to `monochange_cargo` will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/monochange/monochange/releases/tag/v0.3.0) (2026-04-26)

### Changed

#### Update repository references from `ifiokjr/monochange` to `monochange/monochange`.

> _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) _Review:_ [PR #284](https://github.com/monochange/monochange/pull/284) _Introduced in:_ [`021a6cb`](https://github.com/monochange/monochange/commit/021a6cbc86f812a7879b211e83ced5074dccf740)

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/monochange/monochange/releases/tag/v0.2.0) (2026-04-21)

### Added

#### add per-crate Codecov coverage flags and crate-specific coverage badges

monochange now uploads one Codecov coverage flag per public crate while keeping the existing workspace-wide upload.

**Before:**

- Codecov only received the overall workspace LCOV upload
- crate READMEs linked their coverage badge to the shared repository-wide Codecov page
- Codecov patch coverage enforced a 100% target for PR status checks

**After:**

- CI splits the workspace LCOV report into one upload per public crate using a Codecov flag named after the crate
- each published crate README now points its coverage badge at that crate’s own Codecov flag page, for example `?flag=monochange_core`
- the repository keeps the overall workspace coverage upload and lowers the Codecov patch coverage status target to 95%

#### add ecosystem-specific semantic analysis for MCP changeset workflows

`monochange_analyze_changes` and `monochange_validate_changeset` now return real semantic analysis for Cargo, npm, Deno, and Dart/Flutter packages instead of placeholder results.

**Before (`monochange_analyze_changes`):**

```json
{
	"ok": true,
	"summary": "Analysis complete - review suggested changesets for each package",
	"analysis": {
		"package_changes": {}
	}
}
```

**After (`monochange_analyze_changes`):**

```json
{
	"ok": true,
	"summary": "Analyzed 1 package(s) and found 6 semantic change(s)",
	"analysis": {
		"packageAnalyses": {
			"core": {
				"semanticChanges": [
					{
						"category": "public_api",
						"kind": "modified",
						"itemPath": "greet"
					},
					{
						"category": "dependency",
						"kind": "added",
						"itemPath": "tracing"
					}
				]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

`monochange_validate_changeset` now validates authored changesets against that semantic diff and can flag stale symbol references or underspecified summaries across all supported ecosystems.

Current analyzer coverage includes:

- Cargo public Rust API diffs plus `Cargo.toml` dependency and manifest metadata changes
- npm-family JS/TS exported symbol diffs plus `package.json` exports, commands, dependency, and script changes
- Deno JS/TS exported symbol diffs plus `deno.json` exports, import aliases, task, and compiler-option changes
- Dart and Flutter public `lib/` API diffs plus `pubspec.yaml` executables, dependency, environment, and plugin-platform changes

**Before (`monochange_validate_changeset`):**

```json
{
	"ok": true,
	"valid": true,
	"issues": []
}
```

**After (`monochange_validate_changeset`):**

```json
{
	"ok": false,
	"valid": false,
	"lifecycle_status": "stale",
	"issues": [
		{
			"severity": "error",
			"message": "changeset references `OldGreeter` but that item was not found in the current semantic diff"
		}
	]
}
```

`monochange_core` now exposes shared semantic-analysis contracts and diff record types so ecosystem crates can own their analyzers without moving parser logic into the CLI crate.

`@monochange/skill` now documents the semantic-analysis-backed MCP workflows and the expanded cross-ecosystem validation guidance for assistant consumers.

#### centralize manifest lint configuration and split lint suites by ecosystem

monochange now configures manifest linting from a top-level `[lints]` section instead of per-ecosystem `[ecosystems.<name>.lints]` tables, and the runtime engine now loads lint suites from ecosystem crates instead of hard-coding Cargo and npm behavior in `monochange_lint`.

**Before (`monochange.toml`):**

```toml
[ecosystems.cargo.lints]
"cargo/internal-dependency-workspace" = "error"

[ecosystems.npm.lints]
"npm/workspace-protocol" = "error"
```

**After:**

```toml
[lints]
use = ["cargo/recommended", "npm/recommended"]

[lints.rules]
"cargo/internal-dependency-workspace" = "error"
"npm/workspace-protocol" = "error"

[[lints.scopes]]
name = "published cargo packages"
match = { ecosystems = ["cargo"], managed = true, publishable = true }
rules = { "cargo/required-package-fields" = "error" }
```

**New CLI surface:**

```bash
# before
mc check --ecosystem cargo --format json

# after
mc check --ecosystem cargo --only cargo/internal-dependency-workspace --format json
mc lint list
mc lint explain cargo/internal-dependency-workspace
mc lint new cargo/no-path-dependencies
```

**Library-facing changes:**

```rust
// before
let configuration = load_workspace_configuration(root)?;
let cargo_rules = configuration.cargo.lints.clone();

// after
let configuration = load_workspace_configuration(root)?;
let lint_settings = configuration.lints.clone();
```

```rust
// new shared contracts in monochange_core::lint
pub trait LintSuite: Send + Sync {
	fn suite_id(&self) -> &'static str;
	fn rules(&self) -> Vec<Box<dyn LintRuleRunner>>;
	fn presets(&self) -> Vec<LintPreset>;
	fn collect_targets(
		&self,
		workspace_root: &Path,
		configuration: &WorkspaceConfiguration,
	) -> MonochangeResult<Vec<LintTarget>>;
}
```

This release also adds two new support crates:

- `monochange_linting` — authoring helpers for lint-rule metadata and suite construction
- `monochange_lint_testing` — snapshot-friendly helpers for lint reports and autofix output

The Cargo and npm suites now live in `monochange_cargo::lints` and `monochange_npm::lints`, so ecosystem-specific parsing and rule behavior stay with their ecosystem adapters.

### Changed

#### move crate include lists into published manifests

The published library crates in this workspace now declare their `include` file lists in each crate's own `Cargo.toml` instead of inheriting that setting from `[workspace.package]`.

**Before (`crates/monochange_core/Cargo.toml`):**

```toml
[package]
include = { workspace = true }
readme = "readme.md"
```

The package contents depended on the root workspace manifest carrying:

```toml
[workspace.package]
include = ["src/**/*.rs", "Cargo.toml", "readme.md"]
```

**After:**

```toml
[package]
include = ["src/**/*.rs", "Cargo.toml", "readme.md"]
readme = "readme.md"
```

This keeps each published crate self-contained when packaging, auditing, or updating manifest metadata and avoids relying on a shared workspace-level `include` definition for crates.io package contents.

### Refactor

#### Adopt `declare_lint_rule` for Cargo lint metadata and clarify when lint authors should use it.

> _Owner:_ [@ifiokjr](https://github.com/ifiokjr) _Review:_ [PR #239](https://github.com/monochange/monochange/pull/239) _Introduced in:_ [`f30f62f`](https://github.com/monochange/monochange/commit/f30f62f26c5e846448a94b2aa08b5b84d147a27a) _Last updated in:_ [`2bd10ab`](https://github.com/monochange/monochange/commit/2bd10abcd34e0eca9f75cebdfafdf6347dc84ca2) _Closed issues:_ [#234](https://github.com/monochange/monochange/issues/234)

#### align crate docs and readability with the workspace style guide

This pass improves readability and documentation consistency across the workspace without changing release behavior or public APIs.

**What changed:**

- extracted shared crate-level docs into `.templates/crates.t.md` and reused them from Rust `lib.rs` module docs and crate readmes
- added missing readmes and module docs for `monochange_analysis`, `monochange_hosting`, and `monochange_test_helpers`
- rewrote a few nested control-flow sections into flatter early-return or `match`-based forms in `monochange`, `monochange_config`, `monochange_gitea`, `monochange_gitlab`, `monochange_npm`, and the shared test helpers
- replaced duplicated fixture-copy helpers in `monochange_cargo` and `monochange_core` tests with the shared `monochange_test_helpers::copy_directory` utility

**Before:**

```rust
if let Some(existing_pr) = &existing {
    if content_matches {
        // skipped response
    } else {
        // update response
    }
} else {
    // create response
}
```

**After:**

```rust
match existing {
    Some(existing_pr) if content_matches => {
        // skipped response
    }
    Some(existing_pr) => {
        // update response
    }
    None => {
        // create response
    }
}
```

The result is more consistent crate documentation, less duplicated prose, and flatter control flow in a few high-traffic code paths.

### Changed

#### add `caused_by` changeset context for dependency propagation

You can now annotate dependency-only follow-up changesets with `caused_by`, use `mc change --caused-by ...` to author them, inspect the linkage in diagnostics output, and suppress matching automatic dependency propagation during release planning.

#### add the first Dart lint suite foundation

monochange now wires Dart manifests into the ecosystem-owned lint registry and supports scaffolding Dart lint files with `mc lint new dart/<rule-name>`.

This foundation change adds:

- a new `monochange_dart::lints` module with target collection for `pubspec.yaml`
- Dart lint suite registration in the `mc lint` and `mc check` command paths
- Dart lint scaffolding support in `mc lint new`
- tests covering managed Dart lint target collection and fixture filtering

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/monochange/monochange/releases/tag/v0.1.0) (2026-04-13)

### Breaking changes

#### 🚀 Initial public release of monochange

**monochange** is a Rust-based release-planning toolkit for monorepos that span multiple package ecosystems. It is designed from the ground up to support the modern, AI-driven development landscape where agents and automation play a central role in software delivery.

##### What is monochange?

In today's agent-driven development environment, managing releases across diverse package ecosystems (Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, Dart, Python, etc.) becomes increasingly complex. monochange provides a unified, programmatic interface for:

- **Change tracking**: Structured changesets that capture intent across multiple packages
- **Release planning**: Automated versioning and changelog generation
- **Multi-ecosystem support**: Native handling of Cargo, NPM, Dart, Deno, and more
- **CI/CD integration**: Seamless workflows for Gitea, GitHub, and GitLab
- **Graph-based dependency analysis**: Understanding package relationships across your monorepo

##### Why monochange matters for AI-driven workflows

As development teams increasingly rely on AI agents to generate code, manage dependencies, and orchestrate releases, monochange provides the structured foundation these agents need to operate effectively. It transforms release management from a manual, error-prone process into a deterministic, automatable workflow.

##### What's included in this release

This first release includes:

- Core changeset management engine
- Multi-ecosystem package detection and versioning
- Hosting provider integrations (Gitea, GitHub, GitLab)
- Semantic versioning utilities
- Configurable release workflows
- CLI tooling for validation and release orchestration
