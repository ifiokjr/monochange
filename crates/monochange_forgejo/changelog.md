### 💥 Breaking Change

#### Async migration: Tokio async runtime end-to-end

This is a **breaking change** that migrates the entire CLI and workspace from synchronous I/O to Tokio async. All public APIs that previously returned `Result<T, E>` directly now return `impl Future<Output = Result<T, E>>` and must be `.await`ed.

The migration was made to reduce release-planning latency by overlapping external work, adding cancellation and timeout boundaries around hosted-source requests, and removing repeated manifest discovery from common policy paths. On a 200-package / 500-changeset / 500-commit fixture, the direct step-command benchmark matrix improved across every measured command with `0` regressions. Across the eight-command matrix, wall-clock time dropped by about **45% on average** (geometric mean about **3.0× faster**, arithmetic mean about **8.3× faster** because the fastest policy paths improved dramatically).

Notable wins:

- `mc step:affected-packages --dry-run --format json` improved from `1442.3 ms` to `35.8 ms` — about **40.3× faster** — by using configuration-only package/group indexes for changeset-policy checks instead of paying full manifest discovery cost.
- The explicit no-changeset affected-package path now completes in about `7.7 ms`, roughly **159× faster** than the pre-optimization async implementation.
- `mc step:diagnose-changesets --dry-run --format json` improved from `3072.2 ms` to `184.9 ms` — about **16.6× faster** — by using the same fast config-id path before falling back to discovery.
- `mc step:prepare-release --dry-run --format json` improved from `2374.8 ms` to `858.5 ms` — about **2.8× faster** — while retaining deterministic release output.
- Short command startup stayed fast by using a current-thread Tokio runtime for `mc`, `monochange`, and `xtask`; previously noisy commands such as `step:config` and `step:display-versions` now benchmark faster than `main`.

##### Breaking changes — Public API signatures

###### `monochange_core`

- **`git_command`** now returns `std::process::Command` (unchanged for inspection compatibility), but all execution functions (`git_checkout`, `git_clone`, `git_commit`, `git_push`, `git_fetch`, `git_merge`, `git_default_branch_name`, `git_rebase`, `git_create_branch`, `git_delete_branch`, `git_tag_create`, `git_read_tree`, `git_status`, etc.) are now `async fn` returning `impl Future`. Callers must `.await` these.
- **`DiscoverOptions`**, **`discover_workspace`**, and all git helper functions are now async.

###### `monochange_hosting`

- **All provider trait methods** (`verify_release_branch`, `publish_release`, `retarget_release_tags`, `create_release_pull_request`, `update_release_pull_request`, `find_existing_pull_request`, `find_existing_merge_request`, `find_existing_release`, `enrich_changeset_context`, `default_branch_name`, `no_identity`) are now `async fn`. Implementors must update their trait implementations.
- Provider lookup functions (`get_hosting_provider`, `get_provider`) remain sync.

###### `monochange_github`, `monochange_gitea`, `monochange_gitlab`, `monochange_forgejo`

- **All public sync entry points** that previously used `Runtime::new().block_on()` internally are now `async fn`; the sync bridge helper is kept only for tests. Public `async fn` signatures include:
  - `publish_release`, `find_existing_pull_request`, `find_existing_release`, `default_branch_name`, `create_change_request`, `verify_release_branch`, `retarget_release_tags`, `enrich_changeset_context`, `no_identity`
- **`reqwest::blocking::Client`** replaced with async `reqwest::Client` throughout.
- **`github_runtime()` / `gitea_runtime()` / etc.** removed from public API (only available as `#[cfg(test)]` helpers).

###### `monochange_publish`

- **`filter_pending_publish_requests`**, **`filter_pending_publish_requests_with_transport`**, **`registry_version_exists`**, **`crates_io_version_exists`**, **`crates_io_index_version_exists`** are now `async fn`. Callers must `.await`.
- **`execute_publish_requests`**, **`execute_publish_requests_with_progress`**, **`execute_publish_requests_with_process`**, **`execute_publish_requests_with_process_and_progress`**, and **`run_placeholder_publish`** are now async.
- **`reqwest::blocking::Client`** replaced with async `reqwest::Client` throughout.
- **`registry_client()`** is now a sync function returning `MonochangeResult<Client>` (no longer async).

###### `monochange`

- **`cli_runtime::block_on_in_context`** is now a `#[cfg(test)]` `pub(crate)` helper for compatibility tests; production code awaits async APIs directly.
- **`publish_source_change_request`**, **`publish_readiness::publish_plan_package_filter_from_readiness_artifact`**, **`plan_publish_rate_limits`**, and all async CLI step handlers are now `async fn`.
- **`run_publish_packages`**, **`run_publish_packages_with_resume`** remain async.
- **`run_placeholder_publish`** and **`execute_publish_requests_with_process`** are now async and should be awaited directly.
- **Test files** converted from `#[test]` to `#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]` where they call async code.

##### Migration guide

1. Any code calling `monochange_core::git::*` functions must `.await` the result.
2. Any code using `monochange_hosting` provider traits must implement `async fn` methods.
3. Any code calling `monochange_publish::*` async functions must be in an async context.
4. Tests that call async code must use `#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]`.
5. Replace `reqwest::blocking::Client` with `reqwest::Client` (async) in all custom code.
6. Avoid new sync-to-async bridges in production code; prefer async callers and `.await`. `block_on_in_context` is retained only for test compatibility boundaries.

```rust
// Before (sync):
let result = monochange_core::git::git_checkout(&repo_dir, branch)?;

// After (async, must await):
let result = monochange_core::git::git_checkout(&repo_dir, branch).await?;

// Before (sync):
let pending = monochange_publish::filter_pending_publish_requests(&config)?;

// After (async, must await):
let pending = monochange_publish::filter_pending_publish_requests(&config).await?;
```

### 🐛 Fixed

#### Add optional full release staging

Release commit and release request steps now support a `stage_all` input/config field that defaults to `false`. When enabled, the release commit stages every non-ignored working tree change, so generated lockfile updates like `pnpm-lock.yaml` can be included alongside configured release manifests and changelogs.

## [0.4.2](https://github.com/monochange/monochange/releases/tag/v0.4.2) (2026-05-10)

### 🚀 Feature

#### Order publish plans by dependencies

Order publish plans by workspace dependencies before applying registry rate-limit windows, and run CI publishing as one dependency-ordered publish operation.

This keeps dependent packages from publishing before their internal dependencies are available and adds realistic fixture coverage for non-alphabetical cargo dependency graphs.
