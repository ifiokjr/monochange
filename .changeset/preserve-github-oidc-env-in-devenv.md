# preserve GitHub OIDC environment variables in devenv

The development environment's `devenv.yaml` now keeps the GitHub Actions and OIDC identity variables that monochange needs to detect trusted publishing when running inside `devenv shell`. Previously, `strip: env` removed these variables and caused built-in publishing to fail with "No supported CI provider identity was detected."
