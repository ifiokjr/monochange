# Resolve git identity from token for release PR commits

The `release-pr` workflow now queries the GitHub API for the authenticated user's `id`, `login`, and `name`, then constructs the standard GitHub noreply email (`{id}+{login}@users.noreply.github.com`) for `git config user.email`. This replaces the previous hardcoded `github-actions[bot]` identity, so release PR commits are properly attributed to the account that owns the `RELEASE_PR_MERGE_TOKEN`.
