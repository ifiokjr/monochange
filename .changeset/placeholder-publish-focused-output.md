# Filter placeholder publish reports to packages that need action

`mc placeholder-publish` now hides already-published and skipped packages from the default report so dry runs focus on packages that still need placeholder publishing, and real runs focus on packages that were published or failed.

Pass `--show-all` to include the full package report when auditing every selected package.
