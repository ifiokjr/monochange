# Use `GITHUB_TOKEN` for Git Data API to create verified commits

The `release-pr` workflow now passes `GITHUB_COMMIT_TOKEN` (set to `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN`) specifically for Git Database API operations (blob, tree, commit creation, and ref updates). This allows GitHub to automatically sign commits with the `web-flow` GPG key, producing verified commits on release pull requests.

The `GH_TOKEN` (PAT) continues to be used for all other GitHub API operations like pull request creation and updates.
