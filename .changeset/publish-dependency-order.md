# Publish packages in dependency order without readiness artifacts

Package publishing now derives release work directly from prepared release or `HEAD` release state, orders internal publish-relevant dependencies before dependents, and rejects publish-relevant dependency cycles while allowing development-only cycles.

The publish order now works like this:

1. Build the selected publish requests from the prepared release or `HEAD` release state.
2. Materialize the workspace dependency graph.
3. Consider only dependencies where **both packages are part of the selected publish set**.
4. Ignore development dependency edges.
5. Topologically sort the publish requests so dependencies are emitted before dependents.

So for a tree like:

```text
core        # no dependencies
utils       # depends on core
api         # depends on utils
app         # depends on core, utils, api
```

the publish order becomes:

```text
core
utils
api
app
```

If multiple packages are independent at the same depth, their order is deterministic by package id, registry, and version.

A package with no selected dependencies is eligible first. A package is not published until all of its selected publish-relevant dependencies have been ordered before it. Dependencies outside the selected publish set do not block ordering. Development-only cycles are ignored. Runtime, build, peer, workspace, and unknown dependency cycles fail before publishing anything, with a cycle diagnostic.
