# Order publish plans by dependencies

Order publish plans by workspace dependencies before applying registry rate-limit windows, and run CI publishing as one dependency-ordered publish operation.

This keeps dependent packages from publishing before their internal dependencies are available and adds realistic fixture coverage for non-alphabetical cargo dependency graphs.
