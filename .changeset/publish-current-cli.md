# Use the current monochange CLI when publishing release tags

The publish workflow now builds the `mc` binary from the workflow commit before checking out the release tag. Publish jobs still operate on the requested release tag's files and release state, but they execute the current workflow version of `mc` so post-release publishing fixes apply when rerunning publication for an older tag.

The workflow keeps full branch and tag history available after switching to the release tag so publish-time release branch reachability checks still work. The release workflow also dispatches `publish.yml` at the current workflow commit, allowing a fixed publish workflow to publish an older release tag.
