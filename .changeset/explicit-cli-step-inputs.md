# require CLI steps to opt in to inherited command inputs

> **Breaking change** — CLI step inputs are now explicit. Command-level inputs no longer automatically appear in every configured CLI step.

A configured step now receives only the inputs listed in that step's `inputs` field. This removes ambiguous behavior where a command-level flag could unexpectedly shadow a step-specific input with the same name.

**Before:** every step implicitly saw all command inputs, even with no step-level `inputs` entry:

```toml
[cli.release]
inputs = [{ name = "format", type = "choice", choices = ["text", "json"], default = "text" }]
steps = [{ type = "PrepareRelease" }]
```

**After:** inherit command inputs explicitly with the array shorthand:

```toml
[cli.release]
inputs = [{ name = "format", type = "choice", choices = ["text", "json"], default = "text" }]
steps = [{ type = "PrepareRelease", inputs = ["format"] }]
```

Map overrides still work for fixed or templated step values:

```toml
steps = [
	{ type = "PrepareRelease", inputs = ["format"] },
	{ type = "PublishRelease", inputs = { format = "json", draft = "{{ inputs.draft }}" } },
]
```

Migration path: review custom `[cli.<command>]` definitions and add `inputs = ["name"]` to every step that needs a command-level input. Built-in default CLI commands and generated templates have been updated to declare their inherited inputs explicitly.
