#### improve trusted-publishing preflight diagnostics for manual registries

Improves trusted-publishing diagnostics for registries that still require manual setup.

**Updated behavior:**

- built-in publish preflight now validates the GitHub trusted-publishing context for `crates.io`, `jsr`, and `pub.dev`
- manual-registry guidance now surfaces the resolved repository, workflow, and environment when monochange can infer them
- manual-registry errors now explain when the GitHub context is incomplete and point to the exact `publish.trusted_publishing.*` field that still needs configuration
